     * An API is a contract between a caller and a callee. The most common forms of API abuse are caused by the caller
     * failing to honor its end of this contract. For example, if a program fails to call chdir() after calling chroot(),
     * it violates the contract that specifies how to change the active root directory in a secure fashion. Another
     * good example of library abuse is expecting the callee to return trustworthy DNS information to the caller.
     * In this case, the caller abuses the callee API by making certain assumptions about its behavior
     * (that the return value can be used for authentication purposes). One can also violate the caller-callee contract
     * from the other side. For example, if a coder subclasses SecureRandom and returns a non-random value,
     * the contract is violated.
